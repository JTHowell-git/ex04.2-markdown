# Exercise for git, github and markdown

This is an exercise not really about programming, but about skills
that all programmers consider relevant and neccesary.  Your task is to
create (well, rather summarize) a news story in _markdown_, illustrate
it with an image, and upload the page to github.

See the example image about how the result should look like.

## More detailed tasks

1. Create a github repo.  Include the Readme file in that repo.
2. clone the repo to your computer.
3. edit the readme file and make a new story of it.
3. add an image to the story.  Don't forget to `git add` it.
4. frequently commit and push your changes

## Structure of the news story

* Create a top level heading that serves as a headline of your current event
* Write a short introductory paragraph the news event. 
  Emphasize certain words by using both bold and italics.
* Include a quote from the news article, formatting it as a blockquote.
* Display an image related to your article.  Don't forget to add it to
  git!
* Create an unordered list of additional information about your event,
  each of which should reference (i.e. contain an url link) a
  different news source.
* Commit your work (including edits/added files) every once and a
  while. 

# Trump Baby Overrides Law of Land

President Trump today announced he will be issuing an Executive Order demanding 
that a question about citizenship status be added to the upcoming 2020 U.S. Census 
form. The U.S. Supreme Court recently deemed the question **unconstitutional**
yet Trump Baby _insists_ on getting his way. 

>Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he would hold an afternoon news conference on the issues of “census and citizenship” days after his attorney general, William P. Barr, suggested he thought there could be a legal path to placing the citizenship question on the census after the Supreme Court blocked its inclusion last month.
